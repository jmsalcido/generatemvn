generatemvn
===========

I dont remember the mvn command to generate a project, so I build this small and ugly script (first bash script) for some help.

Usage:
===========
Download the script:

    curl https://raw.github.com/jmsalcido/generatemvn/master/generatemvn > generatemvn

Just need to chmod the file:

    chmod +x generatemvn
    
And put it anywhere in $PATH:

    mv generatemvn ~/bin # I use the bin folder in my user folder for user scripts / programs.
